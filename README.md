INTERACTIVE EDUCATIONAL APP

The BBC are looking to improve their online offering of educational content by developing some interactive browser applications that display information in a fun and interesting way. Your task is to make an a Minimum Viable Product or prototype to put forward to them - this may only be for a small set of information, and may only showcase some of the features to be included in the final app.

MVP 
A user should be able to:

view some educational content on a particular topic
be able to interact with the page to move through different sections of content

EXTENSIONS 
Use an API to bring in content or a database to store information.
Use charts or maps to display your information to the page.

TECHNOLOGIES USED: 

This app was built in ReactJS using JavaScript, JSX and CSS languages. The backend is hosted on a MongoDB database. A custom API transfers the data from the back end to the front end.

RUNNING INSTRUCTIONS

To run this app, clone the git repository. You will need to have MongoDB installed in order to run the app's database.

Open up the terminal and open two tabs.
In the first tab, cd into the app's server folder and run npm install. Then run npm run seeds.
In the second tab, cd into the client folder and run npm install.

This will install the relevant dependencies require to run the app to your system. Npm run seeds will seed the MondoDB database.

Next, to open the app:
In server, run npm run server:dev
In client, run npm start

This will run both the back and front ends of the app and open it in a new tab in your web browser at localhost:3000.

If your system is unable to run the app, it's possible that you may need to run an update, so run this command in the terminal in both the server and client folders: npm update

And then run the commands to start the app again.

LESSONS FROM THIS PROJECT:

This was the biggest project I have completed to date, and the first full stack app I built as part of a group. 
The project taught me new skills both in terms of coding and working as part of a team.
I have embellished the app since finishing the project with my teammates, however the structure and styling were all created by the three of us as a group.
This app taught me a lot about data storage, passing data from the back to the front end of an app, many powerful functions that React can offer, and it developed my CSS skills - I can now centre any div you give me!
I really enjoyed working as part of a team and getting to focus on building particular components as we were able to share coding the main app and get it up and running very quickly. We then had plenty of time to build out further components from there.
